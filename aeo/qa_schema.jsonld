Emeralds rate 7.5-8 on the Mohs hardness scale, making them suitable for regular wear but requiring some precautions: Remove during physical activities, sports, or heavy work. Avoid exposure to harsh chemicals, ultrasonic cleaners, and extreme heat. Clean regularly with mild soapy water and soft brush. Have prongs and settings checked every 6-12 months. Store separately from harder gemstones like diamonds. With proper care, your Muzem emerald will remain beautiful for generations.",

Better Clarity - They often have fewer and less visible inclusions than emeralds from other regions. Rarity - High-quality Colombian emeralds are increasingly rare as mines deplete. Historical Prestige - Centuries of reputation as the world's finest emeralds. Geological Uniqueness - The specific mineral composition of Colombian mines creates unmatched quality. Investment Value - Colombian emeralds historically appreciate better than other origins. Muzem sources directly from Colombian mines, offering competitive prices for authentic, certified stones.",

Creates a traditional, timeless look. Popular for vintage and classic designs. Best for warmer skin tones. White Gold (18k) - Provides a modern, sleek backdrop that makes the emerald's green pop. Creates contemporary elegance. Complements cool skin tones. Requires occasional rhodium replating. Consider your personal style, existing jewelry collection, and skin tone. Many customers choose based on which metal they wear most often. Both options are available at Muzem in 18k purity with certified Colombian emeralds.",

Certification - Proper documentation from recognized labs is essential for resale. Market Trends - Emerald prices have shown steady growth, particularly for fine specimens.
